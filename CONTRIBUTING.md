# Contributing to Senior Android Developer Interview Preparation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our comprehensive Android interview preparation resource.

## Project Goals

This repository aims to:
- Provide comprehensive, interview-focused Kotlin and Android concepts
- Maintain production-quality, well-documented code
- Help developers prepare for Senior Android Developer roles
- Create a valuable open-source educational resource

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

1. **Code Examples**: New implementations of Android/Kotlin concepts
2. **Documentation**: Improvements to existing KDoc or README files
3. **Bug Fixes**: Corrections to existing code or documentation
4. **New Topics**: Additional concepts relevant to Senior Android interviews
5. **Test Cases**: Examples and edge cases for existing concepts

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/senior-android-interview-prep.git
   cd senior-android-interview-prep
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the coding standards outlined below
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Test your changes

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add explanation for [concept name]"
   ```

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### File Structure

Each Kotlin file should follow this structure:

```kotlin
package appropriate.package.name

/**
 * # Topic Name
 * 
 * Brief description of what this file demonstrates.
 * 
 * ## Topics Covered:
 * - **Concept 1**: Brief explanation
 * - **Concept 2**: Brief explanation
 * 
 * @author Your Name
 * @since 1.0
 */

// Your code implementation here

fun main() {
    // Runnable example demonstrating the concepts
}
```

### Documentation Requirements

1. **File-Level KDoc**: Every file must have comprehensive KDoc at the top
2. **Function Documentation**: All public functions should have KDoc
3. **Inline Comments**: Complex logic should have explanatory comments
4. **Real-World Context**: Explain how concepts apply to Android development

### Code Quality

1. **Clean Code**: Follow clean code principles
2. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive variable and function names
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should have one purpose
4. **No Magic Numbers**: Extract constants for magic values
5. **Error Handling**: Include proper exception handling where appropriate

### Android-Specific Code

- Android-specific code should be commented out with explanatory comments
- Include import statements in comments for reference
- Provide alternative implementations that work without Android SDK when possible

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

- **Interview-Relevant Topics**: Focus on concepts commonly asked in Senior Android interviews
- **Practical Examples**: Provide real-world usage scenarios
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate industry-standard approaches
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, then show advanced usage

### What to Avoid

- **Deprecated APIs**: Don't include outdated Android/Kotlin features
- **Overly Complex Examples**: Keep examples focused and understandable
- **Poor Documentation**: Every contribution must be well-documented
- **Breaking Changes**: Don't modify existing working examples without good reason

## Testing Your Contributions

Before submitting:

1. **Compile Check**: Ensure all Kotlin files compile without errors
2. **Run Examples**: Verify that main() functions execute correctly
3. **Documentation Review**: Check that KDoc renders properly
4. **Code Style**: Follow the established patterns in the repository

## Pull Request Process

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add coroutine exception handling examples`
- `docs: improve SOLID principles documentation`
- `fix: correct sealed class inheritance example`

### PR Description

Include:
- **What**: What concepts does this PR add/modify?
- **Why**: Why is this change valuable for interview preparation?
- **How**: How does this change improve the repository?
- **Testing**: How did you verify your changes work?

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: PRs must pass all automated checks
2. **Code Review**: Maintainers will review for quality and relevance
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure documentation meets standards
4. **Testing**: Verify examples work as intended
