## 🎯 Overview

This repository is designed to help developers prepare for Senior Android Developer interviews by providing:

- **Comprehensive Code Examples**: Real-world implementations of key concepts
- **Detailed Documentation**: Every file includes extensive KDoc explaining concepts
- **Interview-Ready Topics**: Focus on commonly asked interview questions
- **Production-Quality Code**: Clean, well-structured code following best practices
- **Progressive Learning**: Topics organized from basic to advanced

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔧 Advanced Kotlin Classes
- **Constructors**: Primary, secondary constructors, and constructor chaining
- **Object Expressions & Declarations**: Singleton patterns and anonymous objects
- **Sealed Classes**: Type-safe hierarchies and pattern matching
- **Backing Fields**: Custom getters/setters and property behavior

### ⚡ Advanced Functions
- **Lambda Functions**: Higher-order functions and functional programming
- **Anonymous Functions**: Function expressions and type declarations
- **Inline Functions**: Performance optimization and non-local returns
- **Infix Functions**: Creating readable DSL-like syntax
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing operator behavior
- **Tail Recursion**: Stack-safe recursive functions

### 🧵 Concurrency & Threading
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Async programming and structured concurrency
- **Flow**: Reactive streams and state management
- **Thread Basics**: Thread creation and management
- **Synchronization**: Mutex, volatile, and atomic operations
- **Handler & Looper**: Android thread communication patterns

### 🏗️ SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Class design and separation of concerns
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Extension without modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Proper inheritance hierarchies
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Client-specific interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Abstraction over concretion

### 🔍 Advanced Topics
- **Value Classes**: Type-safe wrappers with zero overhead
- **Extension Functions**: Adding functionality to existing classes
- **Reflection**: Runtime type inspection with KClass
- **Clean Code**: Best practices and code organization
- **Build Systems**: Dependency management and project structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Kotlin**: 1.8 or higher
- **JDK**: 11 or higher
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/senior-android-interview-prep.git
   cd senior-android-interview-prep
   ```

2. **Open in your IDE**:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio
   - The project should automatically sync and be ready to run

3. **Run examples**:
   - Navigate to any `.kt` file
   - Run the `main()` function to see the examples in action

## 💡 How to Use

### For Interview Preparation

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with `learnBasicsKotlin/` if you need a refresher
2. **Progress Systematically**: Move through topics based on your comfort level
3. **Practice Concepts**: Run the code examples and modify them
4. **Read Documentation**: Each file has comprehensive KDoc explaining concepts
5. **Focus on Patterns**: Pay attention to design patterns and best practices

### For Learning

- Each file is self-contained with runnable examples
- KDoc comments explain the "why" behind each concept
- Code is production-quality and follows industry standards
- Android-specific code is commented but preserved for reference
