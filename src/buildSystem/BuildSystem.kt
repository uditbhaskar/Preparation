 * # Build System Concepts
 * 
 * This file demonstrates build system concepts and dependency management.
 * Shows how modern build systems work in software development.
 * 
 * ## Topics Covered:
 * - **Build Systems**: Tools for compiling, packaging, and deploying software
 * - **Dependency Management**: Handling external libraries and modules
 * - **Build Configuration**: Setting up build processes
 * - **Module Systems**: Organizing code into reusable modules
 * - **Package Management**: Managing third-party dependencies

/**
 * ## 🔧 Android Build System Overview
 *
 * The Android build system is based on **Gradle** and the **Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)**.
 * It automates the process of compiling source code, resolving dependencies, and packaging the app into an APK or AAB.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 📄 1. Build Configuration
 * - You define settings and dependencies in:
 *   - `settings.gradle` → Defines modules.
 *   - `build.gradle` → Declares dependencies, build types, compile SDK, plugins, etc.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### ⚙️ 2. Gradle Sync
 * - Gradle parses build files.
 * - Downloads libraries from repositories (Maven Central, Google).
 * - Sets up the project model in Android Studio.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 🧱 3. Build Phases
 * - **Initialization**: Loads settings, identifies modules.
 * - **Configuration**: Evaluates all `build.gradle` scripts, creates the task graph.
 * - **Execution**: Runs tasks like compile, merge, and package.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 🔄 4. Compilation
 * - Kotlin/Java files are compiled into `.class` files.
 * - These are then converted into `.dex` files using **D8**.
 * - XML resources are compiled using **AAPT2**.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 🧬 5. Merging and Code Generation
 * - Merges:
 *   - Manifest files from app and libraries.
 *   - Resources from dependencies.
 * - Generates:
 *   - `R.java`
 *   - `BuildConfig.java`
 *   - ViewBinding/DataBinding classes (if enabled)
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 📦 6. Packaging
 * - Combines `.dex`, resources, assets, and manifest into an `.apk` or `.aab`.
 * - Uses **R8** or **ProGuard** for shrinking and obfuscation (if enabled).
 * - Signs the APK using debug or release keystore.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 📤 7. Output
 * - Final artifacts are stored in:
 *   ```
 *   app/build/outputs/
 *   ```
 * - Outputs:
 *   - `*.apk` → Direct install.
 *   - `*.aab` → Play Store upload.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### 🛠️ Key Tools Involved
 * - `Gradle` → Core build orchestrator
 * - `AGP` → Android-specific build logic
 * - `AAPT2` → Android Asset Packaging Tool
 * - `Kotlinc / Javac` → Compilers
 * - `D8 / R8` → Dexing and code shrinking
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### ✅ Summary
 * ```
 * Source Code + Resources
 *         ↓
 *   build.gradle config
 *         ↓
 *    Gradle + AGP
 *         ↓
 *  Compile → Merge → Dex
 *         ↓
 *   Package into APK/AAB
 * ```
 *
 * Use `./gradlew assembleDebug` or `./gradlew bundleRelease` to trigger builds manually from CLI.
