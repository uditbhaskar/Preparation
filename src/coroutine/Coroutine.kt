/**
 *
 * üîÅ Scenario:
 * You launch multiple child coroutines (e.g., in SupervisorJob or viewModelScope) and don‚Äôt use try-catch inside each launch block.
 *
 * üî• What happens?
 * Each child coroutine runs independently (thanks to SupervisorJob).
 *
 * If a child throws an exception and it‚Äôs not caught inside the coroutine, then:
 *
 * For launch: it goes to the CoroutineExceptionHandler, if present.
 *
 * For async: the exception is stored and only thrown when .await() is called.
 *
 * Only the first uncaught exception in launch is delivered to the handler.
 *
 * Other failures are logged, but not re-thrown or re-handled.
 *
 * They're often silently ignored unless explicitly handled.
 *
 *
 * val handler = CoroutineExceptionHandler { _, exception ->
 *     println("üî• Global Handler: ${exception.message}")
 * }
 *
 * val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Main + handler)
 *
 * scope.launch {
 *     launch {
 *         delay(100)
 *         throw IllegalArgumentException("Job 1 failed")
 *     }
 *
 *     launch {
 *         delay(200)
 *         throw NullPointerException("Job 2 failed")
 *     }
 *
 *     launch {
 *         delay(300)
 *         throw IllegalStateException("Job 3 failed")
 *     }

/**
 *
 * üöÄ Summary: Dispatchers.IO vs Dispatchers.Default
 * Feature	Dispatchers.IO	Dispatchers.Default
 * Purpose	I/O-bound tasks (blocking ops)	CPU-bound tasks (intensive computation)
 * Thread pool size	Up to 64 threads (unbounded-like)	Limited: number of CPU cores
 * Backed by	Shared thread pool with relaxed limits	Shared ForkJoinPool or CPU core threads
 * Best for	File I/O, network, DB (blocking work)	Sorting, JSON parsing, image processing
 * Allows blocking?	‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî designed for blocking ops	‚ùå Avoid blocking ‚Äî meant for pure CPU tasks
 *
 * üß† Internals:
 * üîß Dispatchers.Default:
 * Uses a limited thread pool (based on CPU cores, typically availableProcessors()).
 *
 * Ideal for CPU-bound operations where context switching should be minimal.
 *
 * Uses work-stealing algorithms via a ForkJoinPool-like system.
 *
 * If you run too many tasks here, it may get saturated, leading to performance degradation.
 *
 * üîß Dispatchers.IO:
 * Also runs on background threads, but...
 *
 * Uses a larger thread pool (up to 64 threads by default).
 *
 * Designed to handle blocking operations safely (e.g., Thread.sleep(), network, DB).
 *
 * If you block threads here, it just adds more threads, preventing starvation.
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è Why not use IO for everything?
 * Dispatchers.IO has more lenient limits, but using it for compute-heavy tasks wastes resources.
 *
 * Default is more optimized for CPU cache, thread affinity, and minimizes overhead for CPU-bound coroutines.
 *
 * Blocking in Default can freeze the pool and make your app sluggish.
 *
 * üîç Real-world analogy:
 * Imagine:
 *
 * Dispatchers.Default = engineers doing heavy brain work ‚Üí don't interrupt them, let them think.
 *
 * Dispatchers.IO = clerks doing file/network/database work ‚Üí more of them can be spun up, but don‚Äôt ask them to do math.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Rule of Thumb:
 * If you're doing...	Use...
 * Reading from disk or database	Dispatchers.IO
 * Making an API call	Dispatchers.IO
 * Parsing JSON, sorting large list	Dispatchers.Default
 * Image filtering or complex calculations	Dispatchers.Default
 * Writing to files or preferences	Dispatchers.IO
