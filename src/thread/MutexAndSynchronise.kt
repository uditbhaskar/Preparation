/**
 * In Kotlin, especially with coroutines, a Mutex is used to ensure mutual exclusion,
 * meaning only one coroutine can access a critical section at a time.
 * It's part of kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex and works similarly to synchronized blocks in Java,
 * but it's non-blocking and coroutine-friendly.
 *
 * üîê What is Mutex?
 * Mutex (short for Mutual Exclusion) allows you to protect shared resources from concurrent access.
 * It is used in coroutine contexts where suspending is allowed.
 *
 * It‚Äôs like a lock ‚Äî only one coroutine can "hold" the mutex at a time.
 *
 * If another coroutine tries to acquire it, it suspends until it's free.
 *
 * ‚úÖ When to Use Mutex:
 *
 * You‚Äôre sharing mutable state between coroutines.
 *
 * You want to avoid race conditions.
 *
 * You want to replace synchronized blocks in a suspend-safe way.
